## 📖 Overview

Datamol is a lightweight, RDKit-based Python library that provides a simple, high-level API for molecular processing—covering molecule I/O, conversion (e.g., SMILES/InChI/SELFIES), sanitization/standardization, fingerprinting, visualization, and parallelized workflows.

> **Note**: This documentation lists the **agent-ready wrapper functions** generated for this package. These functions have been strictly typed, docstring-enhanced, and tested for import stability within a standardized Apptainer environment.

## 🛠️ Available Agent Tools

Below is the list of **13** functions optimized for LLM tool-use.

| **Tool Name (Wrapper)**   | **Source**          | **File Path**     | **Arguments (Type)**        | **Description**                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `datamol_convert_from_selfies` | `datamol.convert.from_selfies` | `datamol/convert.py` | `selfies: str, as_mol: bool = False` | `datamol.convert.from_selfies converts a SELFIES representation of a molecule into a SMILES string or into an RDKit Mol object usable in Datamol pipelines.` |
| `datamol_data_chembl_drugs` | `datamol.data.chembl_drugs` | `datamol/data/__init__.py` | `as_df: bool = True` | `datamol.data.chembl_drugs returns a curated dataset of approved drugs from ChEMBL packaged with datamol. The dataset contains approximately 2.5k entries (small molecules only) in SMILES format together with associated metadata fields used by cheminformatics workflows: year of first approval, ChEMBL molecule identifier (chembl id), molecule type, and preferred name (pref_name). This function provides a ready-to-use reference set of approved drugs for common tasks described in the datamol README such as fingerprinting, descriptor calculation, visualization, standardization, and dataset benchmarking. The data file was generated using the notebook Get_ChEMBL_Approved_Drugs.ipynb (https://github.com/datamol-io/datamol/notebooks/Get_ChEMBL_Approved_Drugs.ipynb) on 2023-10-18. That notebook queries the chembl_webresource_client API to collect ChEMBL IDs and metadata, filters for small molecules with valid SMILES and a reported first approval date, and stores the resulting table as a parquet file that is bundled with datamol and accessed at runtime. Behavior details and side effects: the function opens the packaged parquet data file "chembl_approved_drugs.parquet" via datamol's open_datamol_data_file utility with open_binary=True and reads it using pandas.read_parquet into a pandas.core.frame.DataFrame. If as_df is False, the function converts the DataFrame to a list of RDKit molecule objects by calling datamol's from_df conversion routine. This routine transforms SMILES strings in the DataFrame into rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol instances so the returned list can be directly used with datamol and RDKit APIs. The function performs no network requests at call time (the network work was done when the parquet was generated) but does perform local I/O to load the bundled resource. Failure modes and exceptions: calling this function may raise file- or IO-related exceptions if the packaged resource cannot be located, opened, or parsed (for example FileNotFoundError, OSError, or pandas errors related to reading parquet). If conversion to RDKit molecules is requested (as_df=False) and RDKit is not installed or importable, an ImportError may occur. If the parquet file is present but missing expected columns (for example no SMILES column) or contains corrupted data, the function may raise KeyError, ValueError, or pandas parsing errors. When converting SMILES strings to rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol objects, invalid or unparsable SMILES may result in None entries or molecules that fail RDKit sanitization depending on the behavior of datamol.from_df; callers should validate molecules before downstream use. The default behavior is safe for data exploration (as_df=True) because it returns the raw dataframe without requiring RDKit to be importable.` |
| `datamol_data_chembl_samples` | `datamol.data.chembl_samples` | `datamol/data/__init__.py` | `as_df: bool = True` | `datamol.data.chembl_samples returns a small curated sample of molecules drawn from the ChEMBL database (approximately 2,000 entries). This helper function provides an easy, fast source of real-world molecules for examples, tutorials, quick experiments, and tests within the datamol ecosystem. The sample data is read from the packaged resource file "chembl_samples.csv" (originally proposed by Patrick Walters at https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_posts) using datamol's open_datamol_data_file helper, then loaded with pandas and optionally converted to RDKit Mol objects for downstream cheminformatics processing.` |
| `datamol_data_freesolv` | `datamol.data.freesolv` | `datamol/data/__init__.py` | `as_df: bool = True` | `datamol.data.freesolv returns the FreeSolv dataset packaged with datamol. The function loads the CSV file included with the datamol distribution ("freesolv.csv") and returns the dataset either as a pandas DataFrame (default) or as a list of RDKit Mol objects suitable for molecular processing with RDKit and datamol utilities. This dataset is provided as a small toy dataset for pedagogy and testing of datamol workflows (not for benchmarking, model training, or large-scale analysis). The loaded dataset contains 642 rows (molecules) and the following columns exactly as stored in the CSV: ['iupac', 'smiles', 'expt', 'calc']. The columns have the following practical meanings in the molecular data domain: 'iupac' is the IUPAC name of the molecule (string), 'smiles' is the SMILES string representation used to construct RDKit Mol objects (string), 'expt' is the experimental free energy value (numeric) and 'calc' is a calculated free energy value (numeric). These columns are useful for quick examples and unit tests when demonstrating datamol's IO, molecule conversion, and small-scale analysis features. Warning: This dataset is only intended for pedagogic examples and testing. It is not suitable for benchmarking, rigorous analysis, or model training.` |
| `datamol_descriptors_compute_any_rdkit_descriptor` | `datamol.descriptors.compute.any_rdkit_descriptor` | `datamol/descriptors/compute.py` | `name: str` | `Return an RDKit descriptor function by its attribute name from the standard RDKit descriptor modules. This helper is used in datamol (a thin layer on top of RDKit) to resolve a descriptor by name so callers can compute molecular descriptors/features for rdkit.Chem.Mol objects without importing RDKit descriptor modules directly. The function implements a lookup strategy: it first attempts to retrieve the attribute from rdkit.Chem.Descriptors and, if not found, from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors. This is useful in datamol pipelines that build descriptor-based feature vectors for machine learning, filtering, or chemoinformatics analyses.` |
| `datamol_fragment__assemble_build` | `datamol.fragment._assemble.build` | `datamol/fragment/_assemble.py` | `ll_mols: list, max_n_mols: float, mode: str = "brics", frag_rxn: str = None, ADD_RNXS: list = []` | `Build a super molecule from lists of fragment pools by applying retrosynthetic/assembly reactions and yielding assembled RDKit Mol objects.` |
| `datamol_io_read_molblock` | `datamol.io.read_molblock` | `datamol/io.py` | `molblock: str, sanitize: bool = True, strict_parsing: bool = True, remove_hs: bool = True, fail_if_invalid: bool = False` | `Read a single Mol block (MDL molfile block) and return an RDKit molecule object. This function is part of datamol's IO utilities and is used to convert a string containing a Mol block (for example the contents of an SDF entry) into an rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object so downstream datamol workflows (which operate on RDKit Mol objects) can manipulate, standardize, or compute properties on the molecule. Note that potential molecule properties embedded in the Mol block are not read or preserved by this function.` |
| `datamol_io_read_pdbblock` | `datamol.io.read_pdbblock` | `datamol/io.py` | `molblock: str, sanitize: bool = True, remove_hs: bool = True, flavor: int = 0, proximity_bonding: bool = True` | `datamol.io.read_pdbblock reads a PDB-format string and returns an RDKit molecule suitable for use with datamol and RDKit pipelines. This function wraps RDKit's MolFromPDBBlock to convert a PDB text block (for example the contents of a .pdb file or a PDB record returned by a remote service) into an rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object that can be used for downstream operations in datamol such as sanitization, conformer handling, fingerprinting, visualization, and other molecular manipulations.` |
| `datamol_mol_standardize_smiles` | `datamol.mol.standardize_smiles` | `datamol/mol.py` | `smiles: str` | `datamol.mol.standardize_smiles: Standardize a SMILES string using RDKit's SMILES standardizer and tautomeric canonicalization to produce a normalized, canonical SMILES suitable for downstream molecular processing tasks (deduplication, fingerprinting, storage, and comparison).` |
| `datamol_reactions__attachments_add_brackets_to_attachment_points` | `datamol.reactions._attachments.add_brackets_to_attachment_points` | `datamol/reactions/_attachments.py` | `smiles: str` | `Add brackets to attachment points in a SMILES string so that attachment tokens are explicitly bracketed for downstream processing. This function is part of datamol.reactions._attachments and is used to normalize the textual representation of attachment points in SMILES strings before those strings are parsed or used to build reaction templates. It finds occurrences of the module's attachment-point token that are not already enclosed in square brackets (the pattern is defined by ATTACHMENT_POINT_NO_BRACKETS_REGEXP) and replaces each with a bracketed form using the module-level ATTACHMENT_POINT_TOKEN. Example: "CC(C)CO*" becomes "CC(C)CO[*]".` |
| `datamol_reactions__reactions_rxn_from_block` | `datamol.reactions._reactions.rxn_from_block` | `datamol/reactions/_reactions.py` | `rxn_block: str, sanitize: bool = False` | `datamol.reactions._reactions.rxn_from_block: Create and initialize an RDKit ChemicalReaction object from a reaction block string (RXN block). This function is intended for use in Datamol's reaction processing workflows (RDKit-first cheminformatics pipelines) to convert a textual RXN block into a ready-to-use reaction object that can be applied to rdkit.Chem.Mol instances or inspected for reactant/product templates.` |
| `datamol_reactions__reactions_rxn_from_smarts` | `datamol.reactions._reactions.rxn_from_smarts` | `datamol/reactions/_reactions.py` | `rxn_smarts: str` | `datamol.reactions._reactions.rxn_from_smarts: Create and initialize an RDKit ChemicalReaction from a reaction SMARTS string for use in Datamol reaction processing pipelines.` |
| `datamol_utils_fs_join` | `datamol.utils.fs.join` | `datamol/utils/fs.py` | `*paths: str` | `Join path components using the filesystem separator determined by the first path component. This function is used throughout datamol for modern IO operations that must work across local and remote storage backends supported by fsspec (for example: local file system, s3, gcs). The first path component is used to determine which fsspec filesystem (mapper) to use and therefore which path separator (fs.sep) is applied when joining all components. Each provided component is converted to a string, has trailing forward slashes removed, and then the components are concatenated using the filesystem separator. The function does not check whether the resulting path exists nor does it normalize beyond stripping trailing "/" characters.` |
