Below is the list of **12** functions optimized for LLM tool-use.

| **Tool Name (Wrapper)**   | **Source**          | **File Path**     | **Arguments (Type)**        | **Description**                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `stk_molecular_topology_graphs_topology_graph_optimizers_utilities_get_subunits` | `stk.molecular.topology_graphs.topology_graph.optimizers.utilities.get_subunits` | `stk/molecular/topology_graphs/topology_graph/optimizers/utilities.py` | `state: str` | `stk.molecular.topology_graphs.topology_graph.optimizers.utilities.get_subunits: Return connected subunit graphs grouped by building block identifier from a ConstructionState.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_cap_absolute_value` | `stk.utilities.utilities.cap_absolute_value` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `value: float, max_absolute_value: float = 1` | `stk.utilities.utilities.cap_absolute_value returns `value` with its absolute magnitude limited to `max_absolute_value`. This utility is used in stk's computational routines (for example when preparing arguments for trigonometric functions or computing cosines of angles in molecular geometry), where numerical round-off or accumulated errors can yield inputs slightly outside the mathematically valid range; capping prevents downstream domain errors in such functions. The implementation is adapted from pymatgen.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_get_projection` | `stk.utilities.utilities.get_projection` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `start: numpy.ndarray, target: numpy.ndarray` | `Get the projection of start onto target. Compute the orthogonal projection of the vector represented by start onto the vector represented by target using the linear-algebra formula target * (np.dot(start, target) / np.dot(target, target)). In the stk domain this routine is used when manipulating molecular geometry or vector quantities (for example, projecting an atomic displacement, an orientation vector, or a placement direction onto another direction when aligning building blocks, positioning functional groups, or extracting directional components of properties during molecular construction and analysis).` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_kabsch` | `stk.utilities.utilities.kabsch` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `coords1: numpy.ndarray, coords2: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.kabsch Return a rotation matrix that minimizes the root-mean-square (RMS) distance between two sets of 3D coordinates using the Kabsch algorithm. This function is used in the stk library for molecular alignment tasks (for example, aligning atomic coordinates of one molecule to another during construction or comparison). The returned 3x3 matrix, when applied as a right-multiplication to coords1 (which are treated as row vectors), produces coordinates whose RMS distance to coords2 is minimized, provided the input coordinate sets are prepared as described below.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_matrix_centroid` | `stk.utilities.utilities.matrix_centroid` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `matrix: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.matrix_centroid computes and returns the geometric centroid (arithmetic mean position) of a set of 3D coordinates stored in a matrix. In the context of the stk library (used for automated molecular and supramolecular construction and manipulation), this function is used to obtain the geometric center of atom coordinates for tasks such as centering a molecule, aligning fragments, or determining placement points in assembly procedures.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_mol_from_mae_file` | `stk.utilities.utilities.mol_from_mae_file` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `mae_path: str` | `stk.utilities.utilities.mol_from_mae_file: Create an rdkit molecule (rdkit.Mol) from a .mae file for use in stk molecule construction, manipulation, automated molecular design, and molecular/databasing workflows. This function parses a Maestro (.mae) file at the given filesystem path, extracts the atom and bond blocks, and constructs an rdkit.Mol with a single rdkit.Conformer containing the 3D coordinates from the file. It is intended for use within the stk library when converting .mae-format molecular files into rdkit objects for further processing (e.g., building, editing, property calculation, and storage in molecular databases described in the project README).` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_normalize_vector` | `stk.utilities.utilities.normalize_vector` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `vector: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.normalize_vector Normalizes a numeric vector using its Euclidean (L2) norm and returns a new array containing the unit vector. This utility is used throughout stk for geometric calculations in molecular construction and manipulation (for example, normalizing coordinate difference vectors, orientation axes for placing building blocks, and direction vectors used in assembly algorithms).` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_quaternion` | `stk.utilities.utilities.quaternion` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `u: list` | `stk.utilities.utilities.quaternion: Compute a translation + rotation quaternion from three scalar parameters. Returns a quaternion suitable for encoding a 3D rotation (and used in stk for applying orientations to molecular building blocks during construction and assembly). The implementation follows the Shoemake algorithm for generating uniform random rotations (see K. Shoemake, Uniform random rotations, Graphics Gems III, 1992) by mapping three scalar parameters into a four-component quaternion. The function is used in the stk library to sample or apply rotations when orienting molecules, constructing supramolecular assemblies, and performing random rotational perturbations during automated molecular design workflows.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_rotation_matrix` | `stk.utilities.utilities.rotation_matrix` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `vector1: numpy.ndarray, vector2: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.rotation_matrix Returns a 3x3 rotation matrix that rotates one 3D Cartesian vector onto another. This function is used throughout stk when orienting molecular fragments and building blocks so that one direction (for example, a bond vector or connector direction) in a constructed component is aligned with a target direction in the assembled structure. The implementation normalizes both input vectors, handles special cases where the vectors are already equal or exactly opposite (180° rotation), and otherwise constructs a rotation matrix using the cross product and a Rodrigues-like formula. The resulting matrix is orthonormal and has determinant +1; it is produced via scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.from_matrix to enforce numerical normalization before being returned as a numpy.ndarray. Numerically, the function treats vectors as 3-element numpy arrays (3D Cartesian coordinates) and uses an absolute tolerance of 1e-8 to detect equality or opposition of the input vectors.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_rotation_matrix_arbitrary_axis` | `stk.utilities.utilities.rotation_matrix_arbitrary_axis` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `angle: float, axis: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.rotation_matrix_arbitrary_axis generates a 3x3 rotation matrix that rotates vectors by a specified angle (in radians) about a specified 3D axis vector. In the stk codebase this is used when assembling and manipulating molecular fragments and coordinates (for example to rotate building blocks or molecular subunits during construction and alignment).` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_translation_component` | `stk.utilities.utilities.translation_component` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `q: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.translation_component extracts the translation vector encoded in a length-4 quaternion used by stk for placing and orienting molecular building blocks.` |
| `stk_utilities_utilities_vector_angle` | `stk.utilities.utilities.vector_angle` | `stk/utilities/utilities.py` | `vector1: numpy.ndarray, vector2: numpy.ndarray` | `stk.utilities.utilities.vector_angle Returns the angle between two vectors in radians. This utility function is part of the stk library's geometry helpers used when constructing and manipulating molecular and supramolecular structures (for example, measuring the angle between bond displacement vectors, normals of molecular fragments, or orientation vectors of building blocks during assembly and alignment operations).` |
