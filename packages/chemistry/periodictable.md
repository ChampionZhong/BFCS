Below is the list of **21** functions optimized for LLM tool-use.

| **Tool Name (Wrapper)**   | **Source**          | **File Path**     | **Arguments (Type)**        | **Description**                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `periodictable_activation_sorted_activity` | `periodictable.activation.sorted_activity` | `periodictable/activation.py` | `activity_pair: list` | `periodictable.activation.sorted_activity returns a new list of activity pairs sorted first by the isotope identifier and then by the daughter product identifier. This function is used in the package's neutron activation reporting routines (see README: activation calculations based on Shleien (1998)) to produce a stable, human- and machine-readable ordering of activation results so that entries for the same isotope and their daughter products are grouped together for summary and display.` |
| `periodictable_core_get_data_path` | `periodictable.core.get_data_path` | `periodictable/core.py` | `data: str` | `periodictable.core.get_data_path locates and returns the filesystem directory path for the tables belonging to a named extension used by the periodictable package. This function is used by extension modules (for example the 'xsf' extension) to find the packaged data files that provide element tables and supporting data for mass, density, x-ray and neutron scattering, and neutron activation calculations described in the package README.` |
| `periodictable_cromermann_fxrayatstol` | `periodictable.cromermann.fxrayatstol` | `periodictable/cromermann.py` | `symbol: str, stol: float, charge: int = None` | `Calculate x-ray scattering factors at a specified sin(theta)/lambda (stol) for an element or ion using the Cromer–Mann form-factor data in the periodictable package. This function is used in x-ray scattering calculations (see package README) to obtain the atomic scattering factor f(sin(theta)/lambda) for a resolved element or ion symbol. It resolves and normalizes the provided element/ion symbol, optionally applies an explicit integer ion charge override, looks up the Cromer–Mann parameters for that species via getCMformula, and evaluates the form factor at the provided stol value(s) by calling the resulting object's atstol method. The returned value is intended for use in computing x-ray scattering amplitudes and cross sections in crystallography and related applications.` |
| `periodictable_cromermann_getCMformula` | `periodictable.cromermann.getCMformula` | `periodictable/cromermann.py` | `symbol: str` | `Obtain the Cromer–Mann analytic form-factor formula and its fitted coefficients for a specified chemical element and return them as a CromerMannFormula instance. This function is used by the periodictable package to provide the set of Cromer–Mann parameters required for X-ray scattering and form-factor calculations. The returned CromerMannFormula instance encapsulates the numerical coefficients and any metadata needed by other modules in this package to compute atomic scattering factors and related quantities used in crystallography and X-ray physics.` |
| `periodictable_fasta_D2Omatch` | `periodictable.fasta.D2Omatch` | `periodictable/fasta.py` | `Hsld: float, Dsld: float` | `periodictable.fasta.D2Omatch computes the percent D2O in solvent required to match the neutron scattering length density (SLD) of a sample. This function is used in neutron scattering contrast matching (for example small-angle neutron scattering or neutron reflectometry) to find the solvent D2O concentration that makes the neutron SLD of a mixed hydrogenated/deuterated sample equal to the neutron SLD of a H2O/D2O solvent mixture. It assumes linear mixing of SLDs between hydrogenated and deuterated forms of the sample and between H2O and D2O solvent, and uses the module constants H2O_SLD and D2O_SLD (water SLD values evaluated at 20 °C) for solvent SLDs. The deuterated sample SLD (Dsld) is defined to include exchangeable labile protons replaced by deuterons. Note: this function was deprecated in periodictable 1.5.3; prefer periodictable.nsf.D2O_match(formula) for newer code paths.` |
| `periodictable_formulas_count_elements` | `periodictable.formulas.count_elements` | `periodictable/formulas.py` | `compound: str, by_isotope: bool = False` | `Element composition of a molecule or formula string. This function parses a chemical formula and returns the total count of each element present in the formula. It is used throughout the periodictable package to compute elemental composition needed for mass, density, x-ray and neutron scattering calculations, and for rough activation estimates described in the project README. By default the function sums counts across isotopes and ionization levels to give a per-element tally; an optional flag keeps isotopic identities separate while still summing across ionization levels.` |
| `periodictable_magnetic_ff_formfactor_0` | `periodictable.magnetic_ff.formfactor_0` | `periodictable/magnetic_ff.py` | `j0: tuple, q: numpy.ndarray` | `periodictable.magnetic_ff.formfactor_0: Compute the scattering potential for the magnetic form factor j0 at the supplied q values for use in neutron and x-ray scattering calculations. This function evaluates the analytic form used in the package to represent the magnetic form factor labeled j0. In the context of the periodictable package (which provides scattering and cross-section data for x-ray and neutron calculations), the returned scattering potential is a scalar or array giving the form factor contribution at each supplied momentum-transfer-like value q. The implementation converts q to an internal squared variable s_sq = (q/(4*pi))**2 and evaluates the sum of three Gaussian-like exponential terms plus a constant offset using coefficients supplied in j0.` |
| `periodictable_magnetic_ff_formfactor_n` | `periodictable.magnetic_ff.formfactor_n` | `periodictable/magnetic_ff.py` | `jn: tuple, q: numpy.ndarray` | `periodictable.magnetic_ff.formfactor_n returns the scattering potential for a magnetic form factor defined by the coefficient tuple jn at the supplied momentum-transfer array q. This function is used by the periodictable package's neutron/magnetic scattering routines to evaluate a parametric magnetic form factor expression (commonly found in published tables and internal data files) as a function of momentum transfer. The implementation computes s_sq = (q / (4*pi))**2 and returns s_sq multiplied by a weighted sum of three exponential terms plus a constant term, reproducing the standard analytic form used for neutron magnetic form factors.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_D2O_match` | `periodictable.nsf.D2O_match` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `compound: str, **kw` | `Find the D2O contrast match point for the compound in the context of neutron scattering calculations provided by the periodictable package. This function computes the fraction of deuterium oxide (D2O) in an H2O/D2O solvent mixture needed to match the sample's neutron scattering length density (SLD), and returns the SLD value at that match point. It is used in neutron contrast variation experiments and calculations where matching the solvent SLD to the sample SLD is required to minimize or eliminate scattering from the sample for contrast-matching studies.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_fix_number` | `periodictable.nsf.fix_number` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `str: str` | `periodictable.nsf.fix_number converts a numeric string from NSF/periodictable data files into a plain Python float by removing uncertainty notation and a few special characters used in tabulated element data. This function is used throughout the periodictable.nsf data-handling code to normalise numeric fields found in tabular element and isotope data (for example neutron scattering lengths, cross sections, densities or activation-related values). It strips characters used in the source files ('<' for upper limits and '*' as an annotation), removes parenthetical uncertainty notation such as "35.24(2)", and returns only the central numeric value so downstream calculations (neutron scattering, x-ray scattering, or activation estimates described in the package README) receive a simple float without embedded uncertainty information.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_mix_values` | `periodictable.nsf.mix_values` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `a: tuple, b: tuple, fraction: float` | `periodictable.nsf.mix_values: Mix two tuples of floating-point values according to the fractional contribution of the first tuple. This function computes a pointwise linear combination of two equal-meaning sequences of floating-point measurements (for example, arrays of mass, density, or x-ray/neutron scattering values used in the periodictable package) by weighting each paired element by fraction for the first sequence and (1 - fraction) for the second sequence. It is typically used in the domain of material and scattering-property composition or interpolation when forming weighted averages of per-energy or per-isotope value tuples.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_neutron_composite_sld` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_composite_sld` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `materials: list, wavelength: float = 1.798` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_composite_sld creates a composite neutron scattering length density (SLD) calculator for a collection of materials drawn from the periodictable package. The returned calculator computes the coherent real SLD, the magnitude of the imaginary SLD (which should be interpreted as the negative imaginary component in the complex SLD), and the incoherent SLD contribution for a composite made from the supplied materials. This function is used in neutron scattering and reflectometry contexts (as described in the package README) to combine material fragments or large molecules into a single effective SLD so that contrast curves, fits, and other sample-level scattering calculations can be performed efficiently.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_neutron_energy` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_energy` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `wavelength: numpy.ndarray` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_energy converts a neutron wavelength (given in Angstroms) to the corresponding kinetic energy in millielectronvolts (meV). This function is used in the periodictable package's neutron scattering calculations (see README), where neutron wavelengths measured or specified for scattering, cross-section, or activation estimates must be converted to energies for subsequent physics formulae or lookups in neutron data tables.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_neutron_wavelength` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_wavelength` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `energy: numpy.ndarray` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_wavelength: Convert neutron energy (meV) to neutron wavelength (Å) for use in neutron scattering calculations. Converts a neutron energy value or array of energies, expressed in millielectronvolts (meV), to the corresponding neutron wavelength in angstroms (Å) using the non-relativistic relationship between kinetic energy and wavelength suitable for thermal and cold neutron scattering work. This function is used within the periodictable package's neutron-scattering utilities (nsf) to compute wavelengths needed for scattering cross section, scattering length density, and other neutron-beam calculations that rely on wavelength as an input parameter. The conversion is based on the formula λ = sqrt(h^2 / (2 m_n E)), where h is the Planck constant and m_n is the neutron mass; the implementation uses a module-level ENERGY_FACTOR equal to h^2 / (2 m_n) with units chosen so that E is given in meV and the result is in Å.` |
| `periodictable_nsf_neutron_wavelength_from_velocity` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_wavelength_from_velocity` | `periodictable/nsf.py` | `velocity: float` | `periodictable.nsf.neutron_wavelength_from_velocity converts a neutron velocity (speed) to its de Broglie wavelength for use in neutron scattering and related calculations. This function implements the physical relation lambda = h/(m_n v) (wavelength equals Planck's constant divided by the neutron momentum m_n v) and, in the package implementation, returns VELOCITY_FACTOR / velocity where VELOCITY_FACTOR encodes the Planck constant, neutron mass, and the conversion to Angstrom units. In the context of this package (periodictable), this conversion is used in neutron scattering calculations (for example, computing wavelength-dependent scattering lengths, cross sections, Bragg conditions, and scattering length density) as described in the project README and the neutron data sources it relies on.` |
| `periodictable_plot_table_plot` | `periodictable.plot.table_plot` | `periodictable/plot.py` | `data: dict, form: str = "line", label: str = None, title: str = None` | `Plot periodic table data using element symbols positioned by element number and a numeric value. This function is part of the periodictable package and is typically used to visualize a per-element scalar property (for example, atomic mass, density, x-ray or neutron scattering values, or approximate activation estimates described in the package README). It places each element's chemical symbol at a horizontal position given by Element.number and a vertical position given by the numeric value, using matplotlib.pyplot text artists and axis controls.` |
| `periodictable_util_cell_volume` | `periodictable.util.cell_volume` | `periodictable/util.py` | `a: float = None, b: float = None, c: float = None, alpha: float = None, beta: float = None, gamma: float = None` | `Compute the unit cell volume from crystallographic lattice parameters used throughout the periodictable package for density, scattering, and activation-related calculations.` |
| `periodictable_util_parse_uncertainty` | `periodictable.util.parse_uncertainty` | `periodictable/util.py` | `s: str` | `Parse a numeric value with an uncertainty notation and return the numeric value and its 1-sigma uncertainty. This function is used throughout the periodictable package to interpret numeric fields that include uncertainties in data tables (for example isotopic masses, densities, and scattering factors used in x-ray and neutron calculations). It accepts several common textual forms produced in tabulated scientific data and converts them into a canonical (value, uncertainty) pair of Python floats so downstream code can perform arithmetic, unit conversions, and statistical combination of uncertainties.` |
| `periodictable_xsf_index_of_refraction` | `periodictable.xsf.index_of_refraction` | `periodictable/xsf.py` | `compound: str, density: float = None, natural_density: float = None, energy: float = None, wavelength: float = None` | `Calculates the X-ray index of refraction for a given chemical compound using tabulated atomic scattering factors.` |
| `periodictable_xsf_xray_energy` | `periodictable.xsf.xray_energy` | `periodictable/xsf.py` | `wavelength: numpy.ndarray` | `periodictable.xsf.xray_energy: Convert an X-ray wavelength (measured in Angstrom) to photon energy (keV) for use in X-ray scattering and related calculations in the periodictable package. Converts input X-ray wavelength(s) to photon energy using the relation E = h c / λ and internal physical constants provided by the module (Planck constant, speed of light, and electron volt conversion). This function is used by the periodictable package's X-ray scattering and cross-section utilities to translate a wavelength given in Angstrom into an energy value in kilo-electronvolts (keV), which is a standard energy unit in X-ray physics and scattering calculations described in the project README and original source docstring.` |
| `periodictable_xsf_xray_wavelength` | `periodictable.xsf.xray_wavelength` | `periodictable/xsf.py` | `energy: numpy.ndarray` | `Convert X-ray photon energy to wavelength for use in x-ray scattering and optics calculations. This function, periodictable.xsf.xray_wavelength, converts photon energy values expressed in kilo-electronvolts (keV) to wavelengths expressed in Angstroms (Å). It is used in the periodictable package’s x-ray scattering and optics modules (xsf) where wavelength is required for computing scattering factors, cross sections, or optical properties derived from energy-dependent datasets (for example, values sourced from the LBL Center for X-ray Optics as used by this package). The conversion implements the physical relation λ = h c / E using the module’s Planck constant, electron volt, and speed of light constants, and returns numeric wavelength values that follow the input shape semantics of numpy.asarray.` |
